*   Recursive listing of subdirectories with parallel processing (threads) (`-z`)
*   Sorting by size, time, or alphabetically (`-S`, `-t`, `-X`)
*   Filtering by file pattern (`"*.(pattern)"`)

## Practical Examples üí°

1.  **List files in the current directory**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new
    ```

2.  **Show all files (including hidden ones)**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new -a
    ```

3.  **Display detailed file information**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new -l
    ```

4.  **Recursive listing of a directory without threads**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new -r /path/to/directory
    ```

5.  **Recursive listing of a directory with threads**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new -R /path/to/directory
    ```

6.  **Sort by size**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new -S
    ```

7.  **Sort output by timestamp, newest first**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new -t
    ```

8. **Recursively list subdirectories using threads**
    ```bash
    ./ls_new -z
    ```

9.  **Sort files by extension**

    ```bash
    ./ls_new -X
    ```

10.  **Show only specific files (e.g., all PNG files)**
     ```bash
     ./ls_new "*.png"
     ```
